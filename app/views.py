# the login screen and a message is flashed indicating that they were logged out.

# sessions and login required decorators
# Now that users are able to login and logout, we need to protect main.html from
# unauthorized access.
#
# To prevent unauthorized access to main.html ,
# we need to set up sessions, as well as utilize the login_required decorator.
# Sessions store user information in a secure manner, usually as a token,
# within a cookie. In this case, when the session key, logged_in , is set to True ,
# the user has the rights to view the main.html page.
#
# The login_required decorator, meanwhile, checks to make sure that a user is
# authorized (e.g.,logged_in ) before allowing access to certain pages.

"""
1. The last two functions pass in a variable parameter, task_id , from the tasks.html page
(which we will create next). This variable is equal to the unique task_id field in the
database. A query is then performed and the appropriate action takes place. In this
case, an action means either marking a task as complete or deleting a task. Notice how
we have to convert the task_id variable to a string, since we are using concatenation
to combine the SQL query to the task_id , which is an integer.
